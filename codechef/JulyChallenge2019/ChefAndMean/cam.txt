This question can be done with simple mathematics.
Put

s/n = s-x/n-1
x = s/n;

therefore a coin with value of average is to be removed to maintain average

Note: Subtracting average from sum doesn't change the average. Also number of observations must also be reduced.

search for the coin in O(n);
return the first value you find - given
